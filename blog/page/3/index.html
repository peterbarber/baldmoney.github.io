    <h2 id="ebikes-now-theres-no-excuse"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/ebikes---now-theres-no-excuse/">EBikes - Now there’s no excuse</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been a cycle commuter for years, ever since I started employment. In fact I’ve gotten so used to pedalling my way to work, it’s actually a novelty to have to get the train or bus. I must seem like an excited kid on the bus, while everyone around me wears the blank expression that says I sit here every fucking weekday.</p>
<p>Now if only I could get my wife to cycle to work? She normally does pretty well on bike trails and mini bike rides at the weekend in a secret attempt by me to inspire a cycling epiphany, but still her main complaint is the hills in Sydney, to which I don’t really have an answer...until now.</p>
<p>Behold ……. the EBike!   oohhh aahhhh      hold on, what is it?</p>
<p>EBikes are basically cycles with a small motor and battery that kicks in when you pedal. You can go up to 25km/h assisted by the motor (above that you have to use 100% leggy power) and a you can travel at least  50km on a single charge. More than enough for commuting to work and back for most people.</p>
<p>And they are available now, lots of them! Before I read this article <a href="https://rideonmagazine.com.au/new-and-electric-ebikes-explained/">https://rideonmagazine.com.au/new-and-electric-ebikes-explained/</a> I had no idea that there will soon be more than 100 models of ebike available in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>So why bother cycling to work instead of driving or getting the bus?</strong></p>
<p>Well for one your no longer tied to someone else’s schedule, no hanging around for buses that show up late or missing the train as it pulls out the station, nope, you just hop on and off you toddle. Secondly you are building up your cardiovascular fitness and stamina without even thinking about going to the gym and you have to do it or you won’t get home - hows that for motivation? Thirdly you’re saving money, maybe $10 a day which adds up. Fourthly you’re doing your bit for the environment and finally my favourite - whizzing along on two wheels, leaning round the corners -  is like being a kid again - don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what it feels like to ride a bike!?</p>
<p>Ofcourse I can hear you saying, but what about the danger of being knocked off by an enraged nutter motorist?  My answer to this is simple - avoidance. You’ll be surprised how many cycle lanes and quiet backstreets you can find when you look, in fact Google Maps now has a bicycle option in it’s modes of transport chooser which highlights the quickest and safest cycle route from A to B. I usually find after some experimentation I find a route that cuts out most, if not all busy traffic roads.</p>
<p>So on yer bike, what excuse have you got? As my wife once said “I’m almost enjoying this”.</p>

<li>Mr Money Moustache asks if EBikes are the “Gateway drug to Bike Commuting?”. He gives a great post on the options in the U.S.</li>

<p>A friend asked me to look at <a href="http://www.australianethical.com.au">www.australianethical.com.au</a> for your superannuation, I wasn’t very impressed. Maybe ethical for companies, but what about retirees?</p>
<p>1 – Fees are too high MySuper balanced option total fees are (1.134%). The lowest fees are Hostplus – indexed balanced option (0.03%) which works out at about $100,000 less in retirement for a 30 year old on $100,000 a year by age 67. (see moneysmart.gov.au calculator)</p>
<p>2 – Their 10 year performance of 3.7% is well below the average of 5.35% (superratings)</p>
<p>Is $100,000 worth it to outsource your ethics?</p>

<p>You are the only person responsible for your financial future. If it all goes belly up YOU are to blame. Even if you have been given dodgy advice from a financial manager, it’s upto you to do your homework and take responsibility for your investment choices. Do you know how much you are paying in fees?, Does your advisor get trailing commissions? Why have they recommended a certain product over another?</p>
<p>Advisors on commision actually have a conflict of interest, and it could be you that loses out. A alternative may be to see a centrelink financial advisor for free and unbiased advice or at least aan advisor who is paid a flat rate up front and does not accept commision.</p>
<p>Imagine the situation during the GFC where you have just lost 50% of your super annuation balance, the financial advisor just shrugs their shoulders and blames it on the market crash. How would you feel about your future now?</p>

<p>Did you know that a seemingly small fee of just 1% on your investments can result in you losing more than 20% of your balance over 40 years, and that a 1.5% fee can result in you being deprived of around 30% of your investment over the same time!?</p>
<p>I was absolutely shocked when I discovered this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/your-money/give-fees-an-inch-and-theyll-take-a-mile.html?_r=0">fact</a>. This meant that all those managed funds, everyone's investments including their pensions could potentially be missing a huge chunk of change over the long term. And the worst thing about this? Most people will never even know or realise.</p>
<p>The compounding effect of fees is a non intuitive concept that the human brain finds hard to grasp. How could consumers be made aware of this problem? A calculator. An online tool available to everyone. The calculator would do all the hard work of working out the compounding effect of an investment and the difference the fees make to the final balance, all that is needed is for the user to enter their balance, contributions, expected rate of return and of course fees and the calculator would do the rest.</p>
<p>Hence the <a href="/investment-fees-calculator/">Fee Cost Calculator</a> was born. This calculator features on <a href="http://www.spoonfedinvestor.com/fund-fee-calculator/">spoonfedinvestor.com</a> to illustrate the problem of high fees on your total return. More recently I created a specialised version of this aimed at the Australian superannuation market.</p>
<p>Recently the <a href="http://grattan.edu.au/report/super-sting-how-to-stop-australians-paying-too-much-for-superannuation/">Grattan Institute</a> found that Aussie’s are paying triple the fees of other OECD countries for their retirement and this calculator clearly shows what a devastating effect unnecessary fees can have on retirees down under.</p>
<p>Without tools such as this how can the average person be expected to know they are effectively being ripped off?</p>
<p>Want to save thousands or even hundreds of thousands? Try the Fee Cost Calculator and see the true effect fees are having on your life savings before it's too late. Make sure you don't get ripped off!</p>

<p>Recently the Murray Report found that Australian’s are paying double the fees of other Western countries for their retirement. That’s costing us $20 billion dollars each year, or an average of $1100 each!</p>
<p>Why are Aussies being so badly ripped off? Well we could blame the funds for slugging consumers with hidden high fees and bamboozling them with complicated 100 page fund guide booklets but honestly, consumers’ apathy is resulting in them being taken for a ride. Most people simply accept their employer’s fund and never get round to checking how their fund compares. Maybe this is a consequence of the super guarantee system - quietly deducting 9.5% from your wages before you notice, squirreling it away out of sight and out of mind.</p>
<p>The scary thing is how much can be lost. For instance, each 1% lost from the return reduces the balance by about 20% over 30 years. The compounding effect of fees is a non intuitive concept that the human brain finds hard to grasp.</p>
<p>The truth is that superannuation is probably your biggest asset (after your house), yet I’m willing to bet how rarely people read their statement in detail let alone compare its performance with other funds.</p>
<p>Not all funds are created equal. Two camps have emerged - firstly the traditional retail funds from the likes of the big four banks and insurers and secondly, the newer <a href="http://www.industrysuper.com/">industry funds</a> created by industry bodies.</p>
<p>Industry funds are the superheroes of the superannuation industry. They bravely put their members before themselves, unlike the shady retail funds which prioritise company profit over growing their customer’s life savings.</p>
<p>Retail funds tend to have high fees and lower performance, whereas industry funds are generally not for profit and pay no commission so they are generally cheaper, equalling better performance.</p>
<p>Superratings found that in the 10 years to 2013 the difference in performance between industry funds and retail funds has been 1.89% (<em>SuperRatings Fund Crediting Rate Survey – SR50 Balanced Option – Median Returns (December 31, 2013)).</em></p>
<p>Now 1.89% might not sound like a lot, but believe me it sure adds up over the years. Here’s an example of just how much of a difference that 1.89% can make. Prepare to be shocked.</p>
<p>Meet Dave, he started working at age 20 and was put into his company's retail super scheme, retiring at age 65. Lets assume he earned an average salary of $80,000 throughout his career.</p>
<p><strong>At retirement Dave will have:</strong></p>
<p>A balance in his retail fund of <strong>$1,362,212.</strong> Not bad you say, but wait - this would have been his balance had he been with the average industry fund:  <strong>$2,248,762.</strong> Thats a whopping difference of <strong>$886,550</strong> he has lost out on!</p>
<p>So almost <strong>40%</strong> of Dave’s total lifetime contribution has gone bye-byes, never to be seen again!  Would Dave ever have realised this at retirement? Probably not and besides, it’s too late.</p>
<p>The trouble is most people never get to see this side of the story. Your superannuation statement never adds up all the compounded fees and commissions or tells you what these would have amounted to should they have remained invested in your fund.</p>
<p>If they did it might go something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Dear Mr Smith,

Congratulations on working hard for 47 years. We are pleased to say that you have $1,362,212 in super for your retirement.

However we regret to inform you that our fees, commissions and poor performance have resulted in a yearly 1.89% cost, 
which has deprived your fund of a total of $886,550 whilst you have faithfully been investing with us throughout your working life. 
We hope you don’t mind that this is almost 40% of your nest egg and trust that you won’t miss it too much.

Thanks again for being such a great customer and so generously paying for my big beachside house.

Best of luck in your old age

Your Fund Manager


P.S. We would have told you earlier about the effects of our fees but you never once contacted us to check, so naturally we thought you weren’t really interested.

P.P.S. And thanks so much for not asking our advisors for advice, which you have been paying for all this time. That’s jolly nice of you not to bother us.
</code></pre>
<p>It does not have to be like this. The good news is most of you are free to switch to whatever fund you choose, and there are some standout low cost funds out there. With a hour or two’s effort you could save yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars which could make all the difference to you and your family’s retirement.</p>
<p>Don’t suffer like Dave and don’t let them get away with it. Start asking questions, take an interest and take control.</p>
<p>Not sure where to start? The author of this post has produced a valuable report designed to educate Aussies in how to make the most of their superannuation. They’ve done the leg work and found a real knockout fund, which has the lowest fees in the industry.</p>

<p><strong>I'm a big fan of index investing, It's the secret weapon that gives the average Joe the ability to play with and soundly beat the big bully’s of the investment world.</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-index"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#what-is-an-index"><strong>What is an Index?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Companies comprising an Index have to be ordered by a criteria, usually market capitalisation. However indexes can also be ordered by other values such as dividend yield. So the S&amp;P200 you hear about on the news each night is an index is made up of the 200 largest companies on the Australian stock exchange, the banks, the miners, Woolies, Telstra etc.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-an-index-fund-and-a-managed-fund"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#whats-the-difference-between-an-index-fund-and-a-managed-fund"><strong>Whats the difference between an index fund and a managed fund</strong></a></h3>
<p>Managed funds, funnily enough, are ‘managed’ by a human being, the fund manager.  He will usually get paid handsomely irrespective of how they perform.</p>
<p>An index fund on the other hand does not need a sharp suited dealer, it simply tracks the index using a computer algorithm and so does not need paying big fees.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/managed-funds/choosing-a-managed-fund">raging battle</a> between active (managed funds) and passive (index funds) - to sum up, the fund managers are losing, albeit slowly. We bang on a lot about this at MensMoneyHealth, but index funds usually thrash the arse of managed funds in performance over the long term and that’s why we love em.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-invest-in-the-index"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#how-can-i-invest-in-the-index"><strong>How can I invest in the index?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Funds which track indices come in two main flavours, <strong>traditional index funds</strong> and <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/managed-funds/exchange-traded-funds-etfs"><strong>exchange traded funds or ETF’s</strong></a>.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><b>Traditional index Funds</b></td><td><b>Exchange Traded Index Fund</b></td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to buy</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can be purchased from your bank or investment house</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the stock market, so need a broker account or within your superannuation account</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Management costs</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally slightly more cost than ETF’s</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally slightly cheaper costs than traditional index funds</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dividends</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow reinvestment</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually pay out dividends</span></td></tr><tr><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transaction costs</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually zero</span></td><td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broker dealing fees</span></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>We especially love ETF’s as they can be traded just like any other shares in your trading account or even your superannuation account at low cost.</p>
<h3 id="set-and-forget"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#set-and-forget"><strong>Set and Forget</strong></a></h3>
<p>Like an individual company, you don’t have to monitor how well it’s doing in the market compared to it’s competitors or glean insights from the company reports each year. Sit back and relax and let thousands of workers in hundreds or even thousands of companies worldwide slowly make you richer.</p>
<h3 id="multi-headed-hydra"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#multi-headed-hydra"><strong>Multi headed Hydra</strong></a></h3>
<p>Like the mythical multi headed snake beast from greek mythology (or Jason and the Argonauts at least), whereby severing one of the snakes another would grow back in it’s place, Index funds also have magical regenerating powers. An individual company’s share prices may fall to near zero, but then they will simply fall off the index to be replaced by the next biggest company.</p>
<p>An index fund will always end up being the made up of the top companies. This also means that super fast growing companies (think Netflix) will push less worthy companies out of the way and hey presto you automatically get a piece of the action in your fund.</p>
<p>An index of will never drop to zero and take your investment with it, unlike say Enron. However this is not to say that indices are not volatile and can’t crash in value like during the GFC, it’s just that as long as you can wait it out they will always bounce back eventually.</p>
<h3 id="instant-diversification"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#instant-diversification"><strong>Instant diversification</strong></a></h3>
<p>Buying an index tracker is a cheap, efficient way to maximize horizontal diversification. However this is really only ‘horizontal diversification’ which is when you hold different instances of the same asset class. This avoids localised company or sector-specific risks, particularly with shares.</p>
<p>For example, by buying the <em>Vanguard® US Total Market Shares Index ETF</em> (VTS) you are actually buying shares in 3,796 companies worth over US$500 billion! How incredible is that!? You get to own a little bit of Apple, Google, Microsoft ….. and the list goes on,  in one simple transaction.</p>
<h3 id="cheap-as-chips"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#cheap-as-chips"><strong>Cheap as chips</strong></a></h3>
<p>Low cost funds especially ETF’s tend to have very low percentage fees, especially when compared to managed funds. For example the <em>Vanguard® US Total Market Shares Index ETF</em> available in Australia has a fee of 0.05% which equates to a fee of $50 a year for $100,000 invested. Whereas a managed fund with fees of 2% a year will cost you $2000 for the same $100,000. And this differences can add up to a huge amount over the years, see our super ripoff article here.</p>
<h3 id="cost-effective"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#cost-effective"><strong>Cost effective</strong></a></h3>
<p>Buying (or selling) an ETF only involves one trade with one cost say $20. Buying all of the stocks in the index eg the S &amp; P 500 would involve 500 buy trades at $20 a pop = $10,000 cost</p>
<p>Moving between superannuation plans or switching brokers can be done much easier and with much lower cost than say if you owned 50 stocks of companies. With a fund you simply sell and pay one trading fee, (say $10)  with a portfolio of stocks you have to sell all 50 individually (50 * $10 = $500)</p>
<h3 id="get-stuck-in"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#get-stuck-in"><strong>Get stuck in</strong></a></h3>
<p>Unlike individual companies you don’t need investigate the ins and outs of the company books and decide whether this company is likely prosper in the future. Indexes are broad and are great for beginner investors. You can get stuck in straight away with low cost ETF’s of one of the major developed markets e.g. S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, S&amp;P200 or the whole of Europe  without having done much in depth research.</p>
<h3 id="sidestep-country-taxes"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#sidestep-country-taxes"><strong>Sidestep country taxes</strong></a></h3>
<p>Some ETF’s are domicled in tax favourable countries which means you avoid paying your home country’s specific tax. For example buying Reckitt Benkiser on the UK stock exchange will incur a stamp duty of 1.5%. So you would be charged an extra 150 GBP on 10,000 GBP. However buying the Vanguard Irish domiciled FTSE 100 index tracker has no such tax. Again these fees can add up over a portfolio of individual companies.</p>

<p>Index funds have been shown to beat the majority of managed funds over longer time frames. Lower fees of index funds definitely contribute here. Here is my favourite example of how index investing available to anyone can beat the best managed money [<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/946ade3c-f235-11e4-892a-00144feab7de.html#slide0">buffet versus hedge fund</a>]</p>

<p>Like some companies, some funds allow you to have the dividends automatically buy more shares of the index fund without you even having to lift a finger. The ultimate in low maintenance investing.</p>

<p>You might not be able to buy Chinese companies from your broker or super fund, but you will probably be able to buy an index fund that gives you exposure to the Chinese stock market index.</p>
<h3 id="reporting"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#reporting"><strong>Reporting</strong></a></h3>
<p>Some funds send you end of tax year reports that make it a cinch to complete your tax return. Have you ever tried totting up the dividends and capital gains for a bunch of individual shares? I have, it’s not great entertainment - why make tax time taxing?</p>
<h3 id="takeaway"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#takeaway"><strong>Takeaway</strong></a></h3>
<p>So here are our main reasons for loving index tracker funds. If you don’t already use them, we suggest you chuck out those ripoff managed funds and enjoy the benefits of simply tracking a low cost index.</p>
<p>Tell me about your experiences with index trackers? How do you use them?</p>

<p>Just because something is expensive does not mean it is better. Cost is actually now part of the marketing of some products, for example Stella Artois does not hide this fact with the tag line ‘reassuringly expensive’ - think about:</p>

<p>Another parcel is plonked onto my doormap and I'm still in my dressing gown sipping a morning coffee :-)</p>
<p>Why go shopping when you can get someone else to go for you? My toaster broker last week, but instead of making a special trip to the supermarket I hopped on ebay and ordered a new toaster with free delivery, this took about ten minutes. Why not just go shopping?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time</strong> - making a trip to the supermarket is time consuming, its the commute, the parking the wandering round the isles, the queing, it's a much more involved experience. Are any of these enjoyable or productive experiences? Hardly.</li>
<li><strong>Expense</strong> - Not only have you got the travel expense the bigger problem is that you are now in the 'Advertiser's Lair'. How many other items would you notice on route to a percuring a toaster? "Reduced!", "Two for One!" next to Big glowing TV's. How many times have you gone for one thing and come back with a bag full? Did you really need the other stuff?</li>
</ul>
<p>You could argue that at least you're getting exercise while marching round the shopping centre, but wouldn't it be much nicer to stroll through the park surrounded by trees, thinking of things that actually make you happy?</p>

    <h2 id="credit-cards-as-interest-free-loans"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/02/11/credit-cards-as-interest-free-loans/">Credit cards as interest free loans?</a></h2>
<p>Over the last few years I've been making use of the 0% spending rate on new credit cards and then transferring the balance to a 0% balance transfer cards. As you might expect I've racked up a considerable amount of debt, albeit at 0% interest + annual fees.</p>
<p>Now I thought I was being clever by beating the credit card companies a their own game, but now I'm not so sure. First is the time cost of managing these cards, setting reminders for expiry dates, and going through the repetitive and arduous application process. Next is the effect on my credit rating in Australia. I've seen this slowly decrease each time I apply for a new card whether successful or not. Now I own a home in the over heated Sydney market I'm concerned that an average to poor credit rating might exclude me from the best remortgage deals. Finally is the spending mindset it's given me. Just whack purchases on the current 0% credit card and don't worry about it. This results in my tendency to buy stuff without questioning whether I really need it.</p>
<p>The benefit is that I have been able to invest this money in shares and earn a better return than not having the money. But admittedly I'm not sure exactly how much more cash I've made by doing this.</p>
<p>I'm now fortunate to be in a position where time is now more precious than money, this is the opposite of when I was young where money was scarce but time was abundant. Recently becoming a father has reinforced this realisation.</p>
<p>So, that's it. Time to stop juggling credit cards it's just not worth the mental burden. Now which shares can I sell to pay them off?.....</p>
<p>Do you carry credit card debt? Do you find benefit from using credit card offers?</p>
