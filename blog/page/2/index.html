<p>I love reading about Warren Buffet’s ten year bet against hedge funds. He posted the challenge on Long Bet <a href="http://longbets.org/362/">here</a> (The Long Bet site was founded by Jeff Bezos). What’s interesting was that Buffett was initially met with silence and then only one man - Ted Seides of Protege Partners - stepped up to the challenge.  </p>
<p>Buffett stipulated that the average of at least five hedge funds must be compared to the return of the S&amp;P 500 index net of fees over a ten year period. In actual fact Protege Partners selected five funds of funds, so the total number of hedge funds in the running was more than 200. This would mean that  overall performance would not be distorted by the good or poor results of a single manager.  </p>
<p>This is part of Protege Partners argument on Long Bet:  </p>
<p>“Through a cycle, nevertheless, top hedge fund managers have surpassed market returns net of all fees, while assuming less risk as well. ”  </p>
<p>What a load of bullshit! Notice they don’t define how long a cycle is, nor how many hedge fund manager’s are considered ‘top’. While a small minority of hedge funds are bound to beat the average sometimes, what about all the others that just make hedge fund manager’s rich at the expense of their clients or worse silently get shut down for being absolute dogs?</p>
<h3 id="the-final-result"><a class="toclink" href="../../2018/12/30/the-hedge-fund-trap/#the-final-result">The final result?</a></h3>
<p>Total return for the best performing hedge fund of the five fund of funds was <strong>87.7%</strong></p>
<p>Total return for the worst performing hedge fund of the five fund of funds was <strong>2.8%</strong></p>
<p>Total return for the S&amp;P 500 index tracker was <strong>125.8%</strong>  </p>

<p>I recently opened up a new trading account and used the <a href="https://www.klarna.com/betaalnu/klantenservice/questions-sofort-gmbh/who-or-what-is-sofort-gmbh/">SOFORT</a> system to transfer money into the account. This requires you to enter your online banking credentials and then allows you to transfer the money more quickly than a standard BACS transfer. The problems started when I asked my bank about this method of payment. To cut a long story short they had not heard of this system and immediately suspected a scam. I could almost alarms bells ringing as I explained in detail to the bank’s security team. (SOFORT is legit by the way)</p>
<p>Later I received a letter saying that they were not responsible for any money lost, presumably because I had given my online account credentials to a third party. Fair enough. But this got me thinking. Other sites such as Mint.com and Pocketbook that track your spending require you to enter account credentials so they can access your online accounts and obtain transaction lists and account balances.</p>
<p>If a disputed transaction was to occur then presumably your bank would not be liable to cover the cost if you’ve given out your private login details. So beware, account tracking apps are very useful, but they work in such a way as to violate the terms of service with your bank, which could leave you liable. Eventually there will be a proper secure way to allow third parties access to your data, but until then be wary.</p>

<p>The government put in 50c for every $1 you contribute this financial year, up to this maximum of $500. So to get the maximum of $500 per year, you need to put in $1,000 per year as an after tax contribution.</p>
<p>You won’t often find a potential 50% guaranteed return.</p>

<p>I’ve been perusing Superrating’s top 10 funds as you do on a Sunday afternoon. (Yep, I’m a money geek). I’ve found the results they provide to be at best a little simplistic and at worst misleading.</p>
<p>My problem is that they only compare the fees that would be charged on a superannuation balance of $50,000. What if you don’t have 50 big ones in your super account? Well in short ANZ Smart Choice Super might not be the smart choice afterall!</p>
<p>Fees comprise of a fixed cost AND a percentage cost. This means the fees you pay depend on the balance in YOUR account.</p>
<p>Here’s the top 10 funds with the lowest fees (for 50k balance) taken from the superratings website. (http://www.superratings.com.au/top-tens/fees)</p>
<p>Screenshot from 2014-11-30 17:06:13</p>
<p>Now lets see what happens when you jiggle the balance a bit. I’ll take 3 of the funds from above, ANZ Smart Choice Super, Bendigo MySuper and ING DIRECT Super:</p>
<p>ANZ Smart Choice Super Bendigo MySuper ING DIRECT Super Fees on $5,000 per year 75 98 37.5 Fees on $50,000 per year 300 313 375 Fees on $500,000 per year 2,550 2,248 3,750</p>
<p>As you can see, if you only have $5,000 in super, then ING DIRECT Super ($37.5) actually costs less than ANZ Smart Choice Super ($75). If you’re lucky enough to have 500,000 smackers in super then the fees on the ANZ Smart Choice Super actually end up costing you about $300 more a year than Bendigo MySuper.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown of the fixed and percentage fee the super funds charge.</p>
<p>ANZ Smart Choice Super Bendigo MySuper ING DIRECT Super Member Fee ($ per year) 50 98 NA Admin Fee (% per year) NA NA 0.5 Investment Fee (% per year) 0.5 0.43 0.25</p>
<p>So just be careful with these comparison tables, they are a little too simplistic for my liking and could end up costing you money…YOU MIGHT INDEED BE SURPRISED</p>
<p>Be also aware that this superratings data is also used by other comparison websites such as http://www.findmybestsuper.com.au.</p>
<p>As always, don't get ripped off people :-)</p>

<p>It’s usually cheaper to use your credit card (especially if it’s the GE Money 28 Degrees card with 0% currency exchange fee) than to use the default exchange rate provided by Paypal which can be upto 4%</p>
<p>From Paypal's website</p>
<p>“PayPal’s exchange rate includes a processing fee above the base rate at which PayPal obtains foreign currency.”</p>
<p>So they add a cheeky margin to existing rates!</p>
<p>Instead opt to pay with your credit card (fees usually around 0-3%) for foreign currency transactions</p>

<p>I've been using Blinkist for a few months now and while the mobile had a few teething problems I'm pleased to say they now seem ot have been fixed with the latest release.</p>
<p>Blinkist summarises books into easy digestible 'Blinks' which can either be read or listnened to via the audio player built into the app. I've found it a great way to get the overall message of a book in about 10 minutes, rather than spending about 10 hours reading the full book.</p>
<p>All the titles are non fiction and there are plenty of blinks of well known finance books including:</p>

<li>The Intelligent Investor</li>
<li>Think and Grow Rich</li>
<li>The Millionaire Next Door</li>

    <h2 id="dividend-imputation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/">Dividend Imputation</a></h2>
<p>Australia has a full dividend imputation system which gives investors an incentive to invest in Australian companies.</p>
<p>The nice Australian tax office prevents people being taxed again on dividends that the company has already paid tax on, preventing double taxation. We are lucky, the US does not have dividend imputation and the UK has a partial system.</p>
<p>What this means is that 30% tax has already been paid by the company issuing the dividend so you get to claim this back.</p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/#example"><strong>Example</strong></a></h3>
<h4 id="woodside-petroleum"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/#woodside-petroleum"><strong>Woodside Petroleum</strong></a></h4>
<p>100% franked</p>
<p>Current price: $32</p>
<p>Dividend: $2.74 per share</p>
<p>Yield: 8.55%</p>
<p>Franking credit: $1.17 per share</p>
<p>Grossed up dividend (after franking credit) 8.55/70 * 100 = 12.2%</p>
<p>The dividend imputation system effectively gives you a 43% boost to fully franked dividend payments.</p>
<p>You receive payment of $2.74 as a dividend, then at the end of the tax year you get the $1.17 franking credit either offset against your tax or if you don't pay enough tax then a tax refund. This is why I love franking credits, they are refundable, they are available to everyone, no matter how much tax they pay.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-of-a-leg-up-does-this-give-aussie-investors"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/#how-much-of-a-leg-up-does-this-give-aussie-investors"><strong>How much of a leg up does this give Aussie investors?</strong></a></h3>
<p>If you only invested in companies that pay fully franked dividends paying an average dividend of 4%, then after taking franking credits into account you would actually get a yield of 5.72%</p>
<p>Franking credits can only be claimed by Australian residents, so foreign investors don't get this advantage.</p>
<p>Not all companies pay fully franked dividends, in fact only about 330 out of 2000 companies on the All Ords actually pay fully franked dividends.</p>

<p>I've often wondered what would happen to my online accounts when I die and more importantly how my loved ones would get access to them.</p>
<p>Well Lastpass has now solved this problem with Lastpass Emergency Access. In a nutshell - you give someone you trust access to your Lastpass account by nominating them. They then have the abiliy to request access on your death and as long as you don't deny access during the waiting period they then get access to all your online accounts.</p>
<p>A simple and elegent solution that does not involve keeping passwords written down with my Will. Another thing I love about this, is that it will allways be up to date and I don't have to keep a separate store of my accounts.</p>
<p>Bosh, problem solved.</p>

<p><strong>Give away responsibility:</strong> Go to a free investment seminar, sign up to buy off the plan investment property right there and then.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The properties turn out to be hard to rent out, the agents fees eat your profits. The agent operating the scheme closes down.</p>
<p><strong>Take responsibility:</strong> Learn about property investment, read articles, research the pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> You feel confident to buy a modest apartment in a popular location, the rental income produces cash flow.</p>
<h3 id="goal-you-want-to-own-your-own-home-by-obtaining-a-mortgage"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-you-want-to-own-your-own-home-by-obtaining-a-mortgage"><strong>Goal: You want to own your own home by obtaining a mortgage</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility  -</strong> The estate agent suggests a broker, the broker makes a special visit to you and takes lots of personal information, you sign up with that broker and accept the first mortgage they</p>
<p>suggest.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> As the broker only gets commission from some lenders the best mortgage they suggest is one at a 5% interest rate. This costs you $200,000 more than the best 4% rate over 25 years.</p>
<p><strong>take responsibility -</strong> You research mortgages yourself, you find the features you want, you find the most suitable lender for you.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Your mortgage has the best rate of 4%. You save $200,000 over 25 years</p>
<h3 id="goal-fund-retirement-by-contributing-to-superannuation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-fund-retirement-by-contributing-to-superannuation"><strong>Goal: fund retirement by contributing to superannuation</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility -</strong> Your employer gives you the details of their company superfund, you like the glossy brochure and feel safe that the company scheme is good as everyone else uses it.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> You are deprived of $100,000 by retirement due to high fees.</p>
<p><strong>Take responsibility:</strong>  You research superannuation, you find out the basics, you compare the work one to some other funds and see there is a big difference in fees. You see the work scheme is charging much higher fees than an industry fund.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> You save $100,000 by retirement through lower fees. You feel comfortable with the knowledge to switch superfunds to get the best deal.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-wrong-with-giving-away-responsibility"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#what-is-wrong-with-giving-away-responsibility">What is wrong with giving away responsibility?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>You don’t know if you are getting a good deal</strong> - by handing over responsibility you usually have to pay for a service, this is fine if you pay for expert advice that saves you more than it costs, on the other hand a salesperson could cost you much more than they benefit you. How do you know the difference between the expert and the salesperson if you don’t even understand the basics?</li>
<li><strong>No guarantee</strong> - giving responsibility to someone else does not ensure you will meet your goal, there will always be a disclaimer that the outcome ultimately rests with you. E.g. A personal trainer will guarantee to make you fitter but only with the condition that you show up and do pushups every day.</li>
<li><strong>You are dependent -</strong> If your outsourcer disappears you won’t know what to do next, your confidence takes a hit and you will be unable to deal with issues that arise.</li>
<li><strong>Not in your best interest</strong> - Are they getting you to your goal in the quickest and most cost effective way? Look what happens when people entrust their life savings to dodgy financial advisors featured in the news recently.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not advocating here that you do everything yourself, there is a time for expert advice, but advice should be exactly that, advice, the problems start when assistance becomes blind dependence.</p>
<p>In order to get what you want out of life you have to do something to get it. Or in other words to achieve a <strong>goal</strong> you have to do an <strong>activity</strong> in a certain way or <strong>method.</strong> (OK, I admit not a ground breaking insight so far)</p>
<p>For example, to be rich (<strong>goal</strong>), I get more money (<strong>activity</strong>), by buying a lotto ticket (<strong>method</strong>)</p>
<p>It’s the <strong>method</strong> or way of doing an <strong>activity</strong> that I want to focus on. I think <strong>methods</strong> can be split into two types<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Take responsibility yourself</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give away responsibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>give away resp -</strong> letting your partner manage all your finances</p>
<h3 id="goal-you-want-to-have-more-money"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-you-want-to-have-more-money"><strong>Goal: You want to have more money</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>activity: less outgoings, more income</strong></p>
<p><strong>give away responsibility</strong> - buy lotto ticket, take financial advice from an advisor from the bank, let them get you a mortgage</p>
<p><strong>take responsibility</strong> - first look at how much money you have, ask questions, find answers, think what you really want, what is the problem, stop spending so much, try to find ways to earn more. ask a mate how they become so rich, pay for financial advice.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> <strong>You want to be an entreprenuer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activity: learning to work for your self</strong></p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility -</strong> sign up for a course on entrepenuership, do nothing until the course starts and then wait for the lecturer to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it</p>
<p><strong>Take responsbility -</strong> then go and sell something, make something, help someone</p>
<h3 id="goal-feel-less-stressed-and-in-control-of-your-life"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-feel-less-stressed-and-in-control-of-your-life"><strong>Goal: Feel less stressed and in control of your life</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Activity: Meditate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility</strong> - Take a weekend meditation course, learn interesting things, feel great, come home, promise to meditate every day but slowly start to forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Take responsibility</strong> -</p>
<h2 id="what-you-know"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#what-you-know">What you know</a></h2>
<p>Don’t be put off if you don’t know anything about it. Go and fucking type it in Google and spend 5 minutes learning about it.</p>
<h2 id="how-not-to-take-responsibility"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#how-not-to-take-responsibility">How NOT to take responsibility</a></h2>
<p>They are trying to make money by offering <strong>a way</strong> for you to get what you want (indirectly), not what you actually want.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take <strong>this course</strong> to become an entreprenuer *</li>
<li>Come to <strong>our Gym</strong> to get fit *</li>
<li>Buy <strong>investment property through us</strong> and get rich *</li>
<li>Take <strong>this mediation course</strong> to be less stressed in your life *</li>
<li>Buy <strong>this</strong> <strong>lotto ticket</strong> to get super rich and never work again *</li>
<li>Taking <strong>this mortgage</strong> will allow to own your own home *</li>
<li>Taking <strong>our superannuation scheme</strong> will fund your retirement *</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that <strong>the way</strong> does not guarantee to give you <strong>what</strong> you want. <strong>Thats what they fail to mention.</strong></p>
<p>There should be a * next to each one of these statements, where * = but we don’t guarantee it</p>
<p><strong>They offer but never promise</strong></p>
<p>Going to a gym does not get you fit, its what you actually do at the gym that does.</p>
<p>A personal trainer does not alone get you fit, just paying a personal trainer will not magically make you lose 5 kgs, its what you agree to do as suggested by them that makes you fit. <strong>It’s the exercise that you have to do that makes you lose weight.</strong></p>
<p>It comes down to this, ultimately YOU have to do <strong>an activity</strong> to achieve your <strong>goal</strong></p>
<p>Don’t confuse the <strong>method</strong> to do an <strong>activity</strong> with the <strong>activity.</strong></p>
<p>A way to get exercise (<strong>the activity</strong>) in order to get fit <strong>(the goal)</strong> is to get a personal trainer (<strong>a method</strong>), another possible way is to get the stairs instead of the lift. (<strong>another method</strong>)</p>
<p>So we have 2 types of <strong>methods</strong> to do your <strong>activity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>take responsibility yourself - eg climbing the stairs</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give away responsibility - eg personal trainer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>think of how a child does things</p>
<p>If I really, really really, wanted to learn to play the piano, I would draw a piano keys on some paper and then hum along and pretend I was playing the piano, I then might get a book on how to play the piano from the library, I might then see if I could get a cheap or borrow a crappy bontempiu keyboard and just start mashing the keys, until eventually I found noises I like, then get a book, learn the rules, learn chords, learn music. The point is, if you really want to do something, you would simply do it, you would find a way.</p>

<h2 id="advice-or-sales-pitch-the-simple-test"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#advice-or-sales-pitch-the-simple-test">Advice or sales pitch - the simple test</a></h2>
<p>Ask, does this person have something to gain if I do what they say?</p>
<p>It all comes down to others motivations. Why is this person suggesting I do this thing? (take this mortgage, have a personal trainer, buy this house)</p>
<p><strong>Don’t take advice from a salesperson, take advice from an expert you have found yourself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never confuse the two. How do you tell the difference? easy, ask what they get out of it. If they get some kind of payment for their ‘advice’ then walk away.</strong></p>
<p>“You don’t ask the barber if you need a haircut”</p>
<p><em>Warren Buffett</em></p>
<p>Stop doing the indirect and thinking that is enough, is it not enough it is not taking responsiblity, you are simply passing the resposibility for your health, wealth or job fulfilment to someone else.</p>
<h2 id="definition"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#definition">Definition</a></h2>
<p><strong>give away responsibility -</strong> someone else calls the shots, you do what they say without question, without understanding the basics</p>
<p><strong>take responsibility -</strong> you call the shots, but you may take suggestions from experts</p>
<p>Outsourcing motivation only works for so long, because lasting motivation comes from within.</p>
<p><strong>So if you have no interest in finance, is it OK to find an advisor and let them do everything?</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself why you have no interest in your money. It is because it worries you? It is because you never have any left at the end of the month?</p>
<p>This might be OK if you find an advisor who is honest and looks after you</p>
<p>Not to say all courses are a waste of time - just that they should not be used as a way to first learn something. If you really care and want to learn something or make a change then think what can you do right now that will achieve that. Take control, take responsilbility.</p>
<p>You are the boss, you have the plan, you decide what should happen next.</p>
