    <h2 id="dividend-imputation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/">Dividend Imputation</a></h2>
<p>Australia has a full dividend imputation system which gives investors an incentive to invest in Australian companies.</p>
<p>The nice Australian tax office prevents people being taxed again on dividends that the company has already paid tax on, preventing double taxation. We are lucky, the US does not have dividend imputation and the UK has a partial system.</p>
<p>What this means is that 30% tax has already been paid by the company issuing the dividend so you get to claim this back.</p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/#example"><strong>Example</strong></a></h3>
<h4 id="woodside-petroleum"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/#woodside-petroleum"><strong>Woodside Petroleum</strong></a></h4>
<p>100% franked</p>
<p>Current price: $32</p>
<p>Dividend: $2.74 per share</p>
<p>Yield: 8.55%</p>
<p>Franking credit: $1.17 per share</p>
<p>Grossed up dividend (after franking credit) 8.55/70 * 100 = 12.2%</p>
<p>The dividend imputation system effectively gives you a 43% boost to fully franked dividend payments.</p>
<p>You receive payment of $2.74 as a dividend, then at the end of the tax year you get the $1.17 franking credit either offset against your tax or if you don't pay enough tax then a tax refund. This is why I love franking credits, they are refundable, they are available to everyone, no matter how much tax they pay.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-of-a-leg-up-does-this-give-aussie-investors"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/09/10/dividend-imputation/#how-much-of-a-leg-up-does-this-give-aussie-investors"><strong>How much of a leg up does this give Aussie investors?</strong></a></h3>
<p>If you only invested in companies that pay fully franked dividends paying an average dividend of 4%, then after taking franking credits into account you would actually get a yield of 5.72%</p>
<p>Franking credits can only be claimed by Australian residents, so foreign investors don't get this advantage.</p>
<p>Not all companies pay fully franked dividends, in fact only about 330 out of 2000 companies on the All Ords actually pay fully franked dividends.</p>

<p>I've often wondered what would happen to my online accounts when I die and more importantly how my loved ones would get access to them.</p>
<p>Well Lastpass has now solved this problem with Lastpass Emergency Access. In a nutshell - you give someone you trust access to your Lastpass account by nominating them. They then have the abiliy to request access on your death and as long as you don't deny access during the waiting period they then get access to all your online accounts.</p>
<p>A simple and elegent solution that does not involve keeping passwords written down with my Will. Another thing I love about this, is that it will allways be up to date and I don't have to keep a separate store of my accounts.</p>
<p>Bosh, problem solved.</p>

    <h2 id="are-you-responsible"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/">Are you Responsible?</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to achieve the things you want in life, taking responsibility yourself or giving away that responsibility.</p>
<p>For example to buy new car, taking responsibility yourself would be to save by spending less than you earn and giving away responsibility would be buying a lotto ticket and crossing your fingers.</p>
<p>Here’s some more examples</p>
<h3 id="goal-retire-before-your-50-by-investing-in-property"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-retire-before-your-50-by-investing-in-property"><strong>Goal: Retire before your 50 by investing in property</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility:</strong> Go to a free investment seminar, sign up to buy off the plan investment property right there and then.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The properties turn out to be hard to rent out, the agents fees eat your profits. The agent operating the scheme closes down.</p>
<p><strong>Take responsibility:</strong> Learn about property investment, read articles, research the pitfalls.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> You feel confident to buy a modest apartment in a popular location, the rental income produces cash flow.</p>
<h3 id="goal-you-want-to-own-your-own-home-by-obtaining-a-mortgage"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-you-want-to-own-your-own-home-by-obtaining-a-mortgage"><strong>Goal: You want to own your own home by obtaining a mortgage</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility  -</strong> The estate agent suggests a broker, the broker makes a special visit to you and takes lots of personal information, you sign up with that broker and accept the first mortgage they</p>
<p>suggest.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> As the broker only gets commission from some lenders the best mortgage they suggest is one at a 5% interest rate. This costs you $200,000 more than the best 4% rate over 25 years.</p>
<p><strong>take responsibility -</strong> You research mortgages yourself, you find the features you want, you find the most suitable lender for you.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Your mortgage has the best rate of 4%. You save $200,000 over 25 years</p>
<h3 id="goal-fund-retirement-by-contributing-to-superannuation"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-fund-retirement-by-contributing-to-superannuation"><strong>Goal: fund retirement by contributing to superannuation</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility -</strong> Your employer gives you the details of their company superfund, you like the glossy brochure and feel safe that the company scheme is good as everyone else uses it.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> You are deprived of $100,000 by retirement due to high fees.</p>
<p><strong>Take responsibility:</strong>  You research superannuation, you find out the basics, you compare the work one to some other funds and see there is a big difference in fees. You see the work scheme is charging much higher fees than an industry fund.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> You save $100,000 by retirement through lower fees. You feel comfortable with the knowledge to switch superfunds to get the best deal.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You don’t know if you are getting a good deal</strong> - by handing over responsibility you usually have to pay for a service, this is fine if you pay for expert advice that saves you more than it costs, on the other hand a salesperson could cost you much more than they benefit you. How do you know the difference between the expert and the salesperson if you don’t even understand the basics?</li>
<li><strong>No guarantee</strong> - giving responsibility to someone else does not ensure you will meet your goal, there will always be a disclaimer that the outcome ultimately rests with you. E.g. A personal trainer will guarantee to make you fitter but only with the condition that you show up and do pushups every day.</li>
<li><strong>You are dependent -</strong> If your outsourcer disappears you won’t know what to do next, your confidence takes a hit and you will be unable to deal with issues that arise.</li>
<li><strong>Not in your best interest</strong> - Are they getting you to your goal in the quickest and most cost effective way? Look what happens when people entrust their life savings to dodgy financial advisors featured in the news recently.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not advocating here that you do everything yourself, there is a time for expert advice, but advice should be exactly that, advice, the problems start when assistance becomes blind dependence.</p>
<p>In order to get what you want out of life you have to do something to get it. Or in other words to achieve a <strong>goal</strong> you have to do an <strong>activity</strong> in a certain way or <strong>method.</strong> (OK, I admit not a ground breaking insight so far)</p>
<p>For example, to be rich (<strong>goal</strong>), I get more money (<strong>activity</strong>), by buying a lotto ticket (<strong>method</strong>)</p>
<p>It’s the <strong>method</strong> or way of doing an <strong>activity</strong> that I want to focus on. I think <strong>methods</strong> can be split into two types<strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Take responsibility yourself</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give away responsibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>give away resp -</strong> letting your partner manage all your finances</p>
<h3 id="goal-you-want-to-have-more-money"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-you-want-to-have-more-money"><strong>Goal: You want to have more money</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>activity: less outgoings, more income</strong></p>
<p><strong>give away responsibility</strong> - buy lotto ticket, take financial advice from an advisor from the bank, let them get you a mortgage</p>
<p><strong>take responsibility</strong> - first look at how much money you have, ask questions, find answers, think what you really want, what is the problem, stop spending so much, try to find ways to earn more. ask a mate how they become so rich, pay for financial advice.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> <strong>You want to be an entreprenuer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Activity: learning to work for your self</strong></p>
<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility -</strong> sign up for a course on entrepenuership, do nothing until the course starts and then wait for the lecturer to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it</p>
<p><strong>Take responsbility -</strong> then go and sell something, make something, help someone</p>
<h3 id="goal-feel-less-stressed-and-in-control-of-your-life"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#goal-feel-less-stressed-and-in-control-of-your-life"><strong>Goal: Feel less stressed and in control of your life</strong></a></h3>
<p><strong>Activity: Meditate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Give away responsibility</strong> - Take a weekend meditation course, learn interesting things, feel great, come home, promise to meditate every day but slowly start to forget about it.</p>
<p><strong>Take responsibility</strong> -</p>
<h2 id="what-you-know"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#what-you-know">What you know</a></h2>
<p>Don’t be put off if you don’t know anything about it. Go and fucking type it in Google and spend 5 minutes learning about it.</p>
<h2 id="how-not-to-take-responsibility"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#how-not-to-take-responsibility">How NOT to take responsibility</a></h2>
<p>They are trying to make money by offering <strong>a way</strong> for you to get what you want (indirectly), not what you actually want.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take <strong>this course</strong> to become an entreprenuer *</li>
<li>Come to <strong>our Gym</strong> to get fit *</li>
<li>Buy <strong>investment property through us</strong> and get rich *</li>
<li>Take <strong>this mediation course</strong> to be less stressed in your life *</li>
<li>Buy <strong>this</strong> <strong>lotto ticket</strong> to get super rich and never work again *</li>
<li>Taking <strong>this mortgage</strong> will allow to own your own home *</li>
<li>Taking <strong>our superannuation scheme</strong> will fund your retirement *</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that <strong>the way</strong> does not guarantee to give you <strong>what</strong> you want. <strong>Thats what they fail to mention.</strong></p>
<p>There should be a * next to each one of these statements, where * = but we don’t guarantee it</p>
<p><strong>They offer but never promise</strong></p>
<p>Going to a gym does not get you fit, its what you actually do at the gym that does.</p>
<p>A personal trainer does not alone get you fit, just paying a personal trainer will not magically make you lose 5 kgs, its what you agree to do as suggested by them that makes you fit. <strong>It’s the exercise that you have to do that makes you lose weight.</strong></p>
<p>It comes down to this, ultimately YOU have to do <strong>an activity</strong> to achieve your <strong>goal</strong></p>
<p>Don’t confuse the <strong>method</strong> to do an <strong>activity</strong> with the <strong>activity.</strong></p>
<p>A way to get exercise (<strong>the activity</strong>) in order to get fit <strong>(the goal)</strong> is to get a personal trainer (<strong>a method</strong>), another possible way is to get the stairs instead of the lift. (<strong>another method</strong>)</p>
<p>So we have 2 types of <strong>methods</strong> to do your <strong>activity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>take responsibility yourself - eg climbing the stairs</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give away responsibility - eg personal trainer</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>think of how a child does things</p>
<p>If I really, really really, wanted to learn to play the piano, I would draw a piano keys on some paper and then hum along and pretend I was playing the piano, I then might get a book on how to play the piano from the library, I might then see if I could get a cheap or borrow a crappy bontempiu keyboard and just start mashing the keys, until eventually I found noises I like, then get a book, learn the rules, learn chords, learn music. The point is, if you really want to do something, you would simply do it, you would find a way.</p>
<p>Branson, no money, shoe shop, record shop above it. “How would you like it if I could bring you customers every day through your shop?”</p>
<h2 id="advice-or-sales-pitch-the-simple-test"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#advice-or-sales-pitch-the-simple-test">Advice or sales pitch - the simple test</a></h2>
<p>Ask, does this person have something to gain if I do what they say?</p>
<p>It all comes down to others motivations. Why is this person suggesting I do this thing? (take this mortgage, have a personal trainer, buy this house)</p>
<p><strong>Don’t take advice from a salesperson, take advice from an expert you have found yourself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never confuse the two. How do you tell the difference? easy, ask what they get out of it. If they get some kind of payment for their ‘advice’ then walk away.</strong></p>
<p>“You don’t ask the barber if you need a haircut”</p>
<p><em>Warren Buffett</em></p>
<p>Stop doing the indirect and thinking that is enough, is it not enough it is not taking responsiblity, you are simply passing the resposibility for your health, wealth or job fulfilment to someone else.</p>
<h2 id="definition"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/are-you-responsible/#definition">Definition</a></h2>
<p><strong>give away responsibility -</strong> someone else calls the shots, you do what they say without question, without understanding the basics</p>
<p><strong>take responsibility -</strong> you call the shots, but you may take suggestions from experts</p>
<p>Outsourcing motivation only works for so long, because lasting motivation comes from within.</p>
<p><strong>So if you have no interest in finance, is it OK to find an advisor and let them do everything?</strong></p>
<p>Ask yourself why you have no interest in your money. It is because it worries you? It is because you never have any left at the end of the month?</p>
<p>This might be OK if you find an advisor who is honest and looks after you</p>
<p>Not to say all courses are a waste of time - just that they should not be used as a way to first learn something. If you really care and want to learn something or make a change then think what can you do right now that will achieve that. Take control, take responsilbility.</p>
<p>You are the boss, you have the plan, you decide what should happen next.</p>

    <h2 id="ebikes-now-theres-no-excuse"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/ebikes---now-theres-no-excuse/">EBikes - Now there’s no excuse</a></h2>
<p>I’ve been a cycle commuter for years, ever since I started employment. In fact I’ve gotten so used to pedalling my way to work, it’s actually a novelty to have to get the train or bus. I must seem like an excited kid on the bus, while everyone around me wears the blank expression that says I sit here every fucking weekday.</p>
<p>Now if only I could get my wife to cycle to work? She normally does pretty well on bike trails and mini bike rides at the weekend in a secret attempt by me to inspire a cycling epiphany, but still her main complaint is the hills in Sydney, to which I don’t really have an answer...until now.</p>
<p>Behold ……. the EBike!   oohhh aahhhh      hold on, what is it?</p>
<p>EBikes are basically cycles with a small motor and battery that kicks in when you pedal. You can go up to 25km/h assisted by the motor (above that you have to use 100% leggy power) and a you can travel at least  50km on a single charge. More than enough for commuting to work and back for most people.</p>
<p>And they are available now, lots of them! Before I read this article <a href="https://rideonmagazine.com.au/new-and-electric-ebikes-explained/">https://rideonmagazine.com.au/new-and-electric-ebikes-explained/</a> I had no idea that there will soon be more than 100 models of ebike available in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>So why bother cycling to work instead of driving or getting the bus?</strong></p>
<p>Well for one your no longer tied to someone else’s schedule, no hanging around for buses that show up late or missing the train as it pulls out the station, nope, you just hop on and off you toddle. Secondly you are building up your cardiovascular fitness and stamina without even thinking about going to the gym and you have to do it or you won’t get home - hows that for motivation? Thirdly you’re saving money, maybe $10 a day which adds up. Fourthly you’re doing your bit for the environment and finally my favourite - whizzing along on two wheels, leaning round the corners -  is like being a kid again - don’t tell me you’ve forgotten what it feels like to ride a bike!?</p>
<p>Ofcourse I can hear you saying, but what about the danger of being knocked off by an enraged nutter motorist?  My answer to this is simple - avoidance. You’ll be surprised how many cycle lanes and quiet backstreets you can find when you look, in fact Google Maps now has a bicycle option in it’s modes of transport chooser which highlights the quickest and safest cycle route from A to B. I usually find after some experimentation I find a route that cuts out most, if not all busy traffic roads.</p>
<p>So on yer bike, what excuse have you got? As my wife once said “I’m almost enjoying this”.</p>

<li>Mr Money Moustache asks if EBikes are the “Gateway drug to Bike Commuting?”. He gives a great post on the options in the U.S.</li>

<p>A friend asked me to look at <a href="http://www.australianethical.com.au">www.australianethical.com.au</a> for your superannuation, I wasn’t very impressed. Maybe ethical for companies, but what about retirees?</p>
<p>1 – Fees are too high MySuper balanced option total fees are (1.134%). The lowest fees are Hostplus – indexed balanced option (0.03%) which works out at about $100,000 less in retirement for a 30 year old on $100,000 a year by age 67. (see moneysmart.gov.au calculator)</p>
<p>2 – Their 10 year performance of 3.7% is well below the average of 5.35% (superratings)</p>

<p>You are the only person responsible for your financial future. If it all goes belly up YOU are to blame. Even if you have been given dodgy advice from a financial manager, it’s upto you to do your homework and take responsibility for your investment choices. Do you know how much you are paying in fees?, Does your advisor get trailing commissions? Why have they recommended a certain product over another?</p>
<p>Advisors on commision actually have a conflict of interest, and it could be you that loses out. A alternative may be to see a centrelink financial advisor for free and unbiased advice or at least aan advisor who is paid a flat rate up front and does not accept commision.</p>
<p>Imagine the situation during the GFC where you have just lost 50% of your super annuation balance, the financial advisor just shrugs their shoulders and blames it on the market crash. How would you feel about your future now?</p>

<p>Did you know that a seemingly small fee of just 1% on your investments can result in you losing more than 20% of your balance over 40 years, and that a 1.5% fee can result in you being deprived of around 30% of your investment over the same time!?</p>
<p>I was absolutely shocked when I discovered this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/your-money/give-fees-an-inch-and-theyll-take-a-mile.html?_r=0">fact</a>. This meant that all those managed funds, everyone's investments including their pensions could potentially be missing a huge chunk of change over the long term. And the worst thing about this? Most people will never even know or realise.</p>
<p>The compounding effect of fees is a non intuitive concept that the human brain finds hard to grasp. How could consumers be made aware of this problem? A calculator. An online tool available to everyone. The calculator would do all the hard work of working out the compounding effect of an investment and the difference the fees make to the final balance, all that is needed is for the user to enter their balance, contributions, expected rate of return and of course fees and the calculator would do the rest.</p>
<p>Hence the <a href="/investment-fees-calculator/">Fee Cost Calculator</a> was born. This calculator features on <a href="http://www.spoonfedinvestor.com/fund-fee-calculator/">spoonfedinvestor.com</a> to illustrate the problem of high fees on your total return. More recently I created a specialised version of this aimed at the Australian superannuation market.</p>
<p>Recently the <a href="http://grattan.edu.au/report/super-sting-how-to-stop-australians-paying-too-much-for-superannuation/">Grattan Institute</a> found that Aussie’s are paying triple the fees of other OECD countries for their retirement and this calculator clearly shows what a devastating effect unnecessary fees can have on retirees down under.</p>
<p>Without tools such as this how can the average person be expected to know they are effectively being ripped off?</p>
<p>Want to save thousands or even hundreds of thousands? Try the Fee Cost Calculator and see the true effect fees are having on your life savings before it's too late. Make sure you don't get ripped off!</p>

    <h2 id="super-ripoff"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/super-ripoff/">Super Ripoff!</a></h2>
<p>Recently the Murray Report found that Australian’s are paying double the fees of other Western countries for their retirement. That’s costing us $20 billion dollars each year, or an average of $1100 each!</p>
<p>Why are Aussies being so badly ripped off? Well we could blame the funds for slugging consumers with hidden high fees and bamboozling them with complicated 100 page fund guide booklets but honestly, consumers’ apathy is resulting in them being taken for a ride. Most people simply accept their employer’s fund and never get round to checking how their fund compares. Maybe this is a consequence of the super guarantee system - quietly deducting 9.5% from your wages before you notice, squirreling it away out of sight and out of mind.</p>
<p>The scary thing is how much can be lost. For instance, each 1% lost from the return reduces the balance by about 20% over 30 years. The compounding effect of fees is a non intuitive concept that the human brain finds hard to grasp.</p>
<p>The truth is that superannuation is probably your biggest asset (after your house), yet I’m willing to bet how rarely people read their statement in detail let alone compare its performance with other funds.</p>
<p>Not all funds are created equal. Two camps have emerged - firstly the traditional retail funds from the likes of the big four banks and insurers and secondly, the newer <a href="http://www.industrysuper.com/">industry funds</a> created by industry bodies.</p>
<p>Industry funds are the superheroes of the superannuation industry. They bravely put their members before themselves, unlike the shady retail funds which prioritise company profit over growing their customer’s life savings.</p>
<p>Retail funds tend to have high fees and lower performance, whereas industry funds are generally not for profit and pay no commission so they are generally cheaper, equalling better performance.</p>
<p>Superratings found that in the 10 years to 2013 the difference in performance between industry funds and retail funds has been 1.89% (<em>SuperRatings Fund Crediting Rate Survey – SR50 Balanced Option – Median Returns (December 31, 2013)).</em></p>
<p>Now 1.89% might not sound like a lot, but believe me it sure adds up over the years. Here’s an example of just how much of a difference that 1.89% can make. Prepare to be shocked.</p>
<p>Meet Dave, he started working at age 20 and was put into his company's retail super scheme, retiring at age 65. Lets assume he earned an average salary of $80,000 throughout his career.</p>
<p><strong>At retirement Dave will have:</strong></p>
<p>A balance in his retail fund of <strong>$1,362,212.</strong> Not bad you say, but wait - this would have been his balance had he been with the average industry fund:  <strong>$2,248,762.</strong> Thats a whopping difference of <strong>$886,550</strong> he has lost out on!</p>
<p>So almost <strong>40%</strong> of Dave’s total lifetime contribution has gone bye-byes, never to be seen again!  Would Dave ever have realised this at retirement? Probably not and besides, it’s too late.</p>
<p>The trouble is most people never get to see this side of the story. Your superannuation statement never adds up all the compounded fees and commissions or tells you what these would have amounted to should they have remained invested in your fund.</p>
<p>If they did it might go something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Dear Mr Smith,

Congratulations on working hard for 47 years. We are pleased to say that you have $1,362,212 in super for your retirement.

However we regret to inform you that our fees, commissions and poor performance have resulted in a yearly 1.89% cost, 
which has deprived your fund of a total of $886,550 whilst you have faithfully been investing with us throughout your working life. 
We hope you don’t mind that this is almost 40% of your nest egg and trust that you won’t miss it too much.

Thanks again for being such a great customer and so generously paying for my big beachside house.

Best of luck in your old age

Your Fund Manager


P.S. We would have told you earlier about the effects of our fees but you never once contacted us to check, so naturally we thought you weren’t really interested.

P.P.S. And thanks so much for not asking our advisors for advice, which you have been paying for all this time. That’s jolly nice of you not to bother us.
</code></pre>
<p>It does not have to be like this. The good news is most of you are free to switch to whatever fund you choose, and there are some standout low cost funds out there. With a hour or two’s effort you could save yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars which could make all the difference to you and your family’s retirement.</p>
<p>Don’t suffer like Dave and don’t let them get away with it. Start asking questions, take an interest and take control.</p>
<p>Not sure where to start? The author of this post has produced a valuable report designed to educate Aussies in how to make the most of their superannuation. They’ve done the leg work and found a real knockout fund, which has the lowest fees in the industry.</p>

<p><strong>I'm a big fan of index investing, It's the secret weapon that gives the average Joe the ability to play with and soundly beat the big bully’s of the investment world.</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-is-an-index"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#what-is-an-index"><strong>What is an Index?</strong></a></h3>
<p>Companies comprising an Index have to be ordered by a criteria, usually market capitalisation. However indexes can also be ordered by other values such as dividend yield. So the S&amp;P200 you hear about on the news each night is an index is made up of the 200 largest companies on the Australian stock exchange, the banks, the miners, Woolies, Telstra etc.</p>
<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-an-index-fund-and-a-managed-fund"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#whats-the-difference-between-an-index-fund-and-a-managed-fund"><strong>Whats the difference between an index fund and a managed fund</strong></a></h3>
<p>Managed funds, funnily enough, are ‘managed’ by a human being, the fund manager.  He will usually get paid handsomely irrespective of how they perform.</p>
<p>An index fund on the other hand does not need a sharp suited dealer, it simply tracks the index using a computer algorithm and so does not need paying big fees.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/managed-funds/choosing-a-managed-fund">raging battle</a> between active (managed funds) and passive (index funds) - to sum up, the fund managers are losing, albeit slowly. We bang on a lot about this at MensMoneyHealth, but index funds usually thrash the arse of managed funds in performance over the long term and that’s why we love em.</p>

<p>Funds which track indices come in two main flavours, <strong>traditional index funds</strong> and <a href="https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/investing/managed-funds/exchange-traded-funds-etfs"><strong>exchange traded funds or ETF’s</strong></a>.</p>

<p>We especially love ETF’s as they can be traded just like any other shares in your trading account or even your superannuation account at low cost.</p>
<h3 id="set-and-forget"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#set-and-forget"><strong>Set and Forget</strong></a></h3>
<p>Like an individual company, you don’t have to monitor how well it’s doing in the market compared to it’s competitors or glean insights from the company reports each year. Sit back and relax and let thousands of workers in hundreds or even thousands of companies worldwide slowly make you richer.</p>
<h3 id="multi-headed-hydra"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#multi-headed-hydra"><strong>Multi headed Hydra</strong></a></h3>
<p>Like the mythical multi headed snake beast from greek mythology (or Jason and the Argonauts at least), whereby severing one of the snakes another would grow back in it’s place, Index funds also have magical regenerating powers. An individual company’s share prices may fall to near zero, but then they will simply fall off the index to be replaced by the next biggest company.</p>
<p>An index fund will always end up being the made up of the top companies. This also means that super fast growing companies (think Netflix) will push less worthy companies out of the way and hey presto you automatically get a piece of the action in your fund.</p>
<p>An index of will never drop to zero and take your investment with it, unlike say Enron. However this is not to say that indices are not volatile and can’t crash in value like during the GFC, it’s just that as long as you can wait it out they will always bounce back eventually.</p>
<h3 id="instant-diversification"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#instant-diversification"><strong>Instant diversification</strong></a></h3>
<p>Buying an index tracker is a cheap, efficient way to maximize horizontal diversification. However this is really only ‘horizontal diversification’ which is when you hold different instances of the same asset class. This avoids localised company or sector-specific risks, particularly with shares.</p>
<p>For example, by buying the <em>Vanguard® US Total Market Shares Index ETF</em> (VTS) you are actually buying shares in 3,796 companies worth over US$500 billion! How incredible is that!? You get to own a little bit of Apple, Google, Microsoft ….. and the list goes on,  in one simple transaction.</p>
<h3 id="cheap-as-chips"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#cheap-as-chips"><strong>Cheap as chips</strong></a></h3>
<p>Low cost funds especially ETF’s tend to have very low percentage fees, especially when compared to managed funds. For example the <em>Vanguard® US Total Market Shares Index ETF</em> available in Australia has a fee of 0.05% which equates to a fee of $50 a year for $100,000 invested. Whereas a managed fund with fees of 2% a year will cost you $2000 for the same $100,000. And this differences can add up to a huge amount over the years, see our super ripoff article here.</p>
<h3 id="cost-effective"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#cost-effective"><strong>Cost effective</strong></a></h3>
<p>Buying (or selling) an ETF only involves one trade with one cost say $20. Buying all of the stocks in the index eg the S &amp; P 500 would involve 500 buy trades at $20 a pop = $10,000 cost</p>
<p>Moving between superannuation plans or switching brokers can be done much easier and with much lower cost than say if you owned 50 stocks of companies. With a fund you simply sell and pay one trading fee, (say $10)  with a portfolio of stocks you have to sell all 50 individually (50 * $10 = $500)</p>
<h3 id="get-stuck-in"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#get-stuck-in"><strong>Get stuck in</strong></a></h3>
<p>Unlike individual companies you don’t need investigate the ins and outs of the company books and decide whether this company is likely prosper in the future. Indexes are broad and are great for beginner investors. You can get stuck in straight away with low cost ETF’s of one of the major developed markets e.g. S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, S&amp;P200 or the whole of Europe  without having done much in depth research.</p>
<h3 id="sidestep-country-taxes"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#sidestep-country-taxes"><strong>Sidestep country taxes</strong></a></h3>
<p>Some ETF’s are domicled in tax favourable countries which means you avoid paying your home country’s specific tax. For example buying Reckitt Benkiser on the UK stock exchange will incur a stamp duty of 1.5%. So you would be charged an extra 150 GBP on 10,000 GBP. However buying the Vanguard Irish domiciled FTSE 100 index tracker has no such tax. Again these fees can add up over a portfolio of individual companies.</p>
<h3 id="you-get-what-you-dont-pay-for"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#you-get-what-you-dont-pay-for"><strong>You get what you don’t pay for</strong></a></h3>
<p>Index funds have been shown to beat the majority of managed funds over longer time frames. Lower fees of index funds definitely contribute here. Here is my favourite example of how index investing available to anyone can beat the best managed money [<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/946ade3c-f235-11e4-892a-00144feab7de.html#slide0">buffet versus hedge fund</a>]</p>
<h3 id="dividend-reinvestment-plan"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#dividend-reinvestment-plan"><strong>Dividend reinvestment plan</strong></a></h3>
<p>Like some companies, some funds allow you to have the dividends automatically buy more shares of the index fund without you even having to lift a finger. The ultimate in low maintenance investing.</p>
<h3 id="access-to-wordwide-markets"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#access-to-wordwide-markets"><strong>Access to wordwide markets</strong></a></h3>
<p>You might not be able to buy Chinese companies from your broker or super fund, but you will probably be able to buy an index fund that gives you exposure to the Chinese stock market index.</p>
<h3 id="reporting"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#reporting"><strong>Reporting</strong></a></h3>
<p>Some funds send you end of tax year reports that make it a cinch to complete your tax return. Have you ever tried totting up the dividends and capital gains for a bunch of individual shares? I have, it’s not great entertainment - why make tax time taxing?</p>
<h3 id="takeaway"><a class="toclink" href="../../2017/03/19/the-joy-of-index-investing/#takeaway"><strong>Takeaway</strong></a></h3>
<p>So here are our main reasons for loving index tracker funds. If you don’t already use them, we suggest you chuck out those ripoff managed funds and enjoy the benefits of simply tracking a low cost index.</p>
<p>Tell me about your experiences with index trackers? How do you use them?</p>

<p>Just because something is expensive does not mean it is better. Cost is actually now part of the marketing of some products, for example Stella Artois does not hide this fact with the tag line ‘reassuringly expensive’ - think about:</p>
