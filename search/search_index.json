In fact I\u2019ve gotten so used to pedalling my way to work, it\u2019s actually a novelty to have to get the train or bus. I must seem like an excited kid on the bus, while everyone around me wears the blank expression that says I sit here every fucking weekday.</p> <p>Now if only I could get my wife to cycle to work? She normally does pretty well on bike trails and mini bike rides at the weekend in a secret attempt by me to inspire a cycling epiphany, but still her main complaint is the hills in Sydney, to which I don\u2019t really have an answer...until now.</p> <p>Behold \u2026\u2026. the EBike! \u00a0\u00a0oohhh aahhhh \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hold on, what is it?</p> <p>EBikes are basically cycles with a small motor and battery that kicks in when you pedal. You can go up to 25km/h assisted by the motor (above that you have to use 100% leggy power) and a you can travel at least \u00a050km on a single charge. More than enough for commuting to work and back for most people.</p> <p>And they are available now, lots of them! Before I read this article https://rideonmagazine.com.au/new-and-electric-ebikes-explained/ I had no idea that there will soon be more than 100 models of ebike available in Australia.</p> <p>So why bother cycling to work instead of driving or getting the bus?</p> <p>Well for one your no longer tied to someone else\u2019s schedule, no hanging around for buses that show up late or missing the train as it pulls out the station, nope, you just hop on and off you toddle. Secondly you are building up your cardiovascular fitness and stamina without even thinking about going to the gym and you have to do it or you won\u2019t get home - hows that for motivation? Thirdly you\u2019re saving money, maybe $10 a day which adds up. Fourthly you\u2019re doing your bit for the environment and finally my favourite - whizzing along on two wheels, leaning round the corners - \u00a0is like being a kid again - don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten what it feels like to ride a bike!?</p> <p>Ofcourse I can hear you saying, but what about the danger of being knocked off by an enraged nutter motorist? \u00a0My answer to this is simple - avoidance. You\u2019ll be surprised how many cycle lanes and quiet backstreets you can find when you look, in fact Google Maps now has a bicycle option in it\u2019s modes of transport chooser which highlights the quickest and safest cycle route from A to B.

This meant that all those managed funds, everyone's investments including their pensions could potentially be missing a huge chunk of change over the long term. And the worst thing about this?

That\u2019s costing us $20 billion dollars each year, or an average of $1100 each!</p> <p>Why are Aussies being so badly ripped off? Well we could blame the funds for slugging consumers with hidden high fees and bamboozling them with complicated 100 page fund guide booklets but honestly, consumers\u2019 apathy is resulting in them being taken for a ride. Most people simply accept their employer\u2019s fund and never get round to checking how their fund compares. Maybe this is a consequence of the super guarantee system - quietly deducting 9.5% from your wages before you notice, squirreling it away out of sight and out of mind.</p> <p>The scary thing is how much can be lost. For instance, each 1% lost from the return reduces the balance by about 20% over 30 years. The compounding effect of fees is a non intuitive concept that the human brain finds hard to grasp.</p> <p>The truth is that superannuation is probably your biggest asset (after your house), yet I\u2019m willing to bet how rarely people read their statement in detail let alone compare its performance with other funds.</p> <p>Not all funds are created equal. Two camps have emerged - firstly the traditional retail funds from the likes of the big four banks and insurers and secondly, the newer industry funds created by industry bodies.</p> <p>Industry funds are the superheroes of the superannuation industry. They bravely put their members before themselves, unlike the shady retail funds which prioritise company profit over growing their customer\u2019s life savings.</p> <p>Retail funds tend to have high fees and lower performance, whereas industry funds are generally not for profit and pay no commission so they are generally cheaper, equalling better performance.</p> <p>Superratings found that in the 10 years to 2013 the difference in performance between industry funds and retail funds has been 1.89% (SuperRatings Fund Crediting Rate Survey \u2013 SR50 Balanced Option \u2013 Median Returns (December 31, 2013)).</p> <p>Now 1.89% might not sound like a lot, but believe me it sure adds up over the years. Here\u2019s an example of just how much of a difference that 1.89% can make. Prepare to be shocked.</p> <p>Meet Dave, he started working at age 20 and was put into his company's retail super scheme, retiring at age 65. Lets assume he earned an average salary of $80,000 throughout his career.</p> <p>At retirement Dave will have:</p> <p>A balance in his retail fund of $1,362,212. Not bad you say, but wait - this would have been his balance had he been with the average industry fund: \u00a0$2,248,762. Thats a whopping difference of $886,550 he has lost out on!</p> <p>So almost 40% of Dave\u2019s total lifetime contribution has gone bye-byes, never to be seen again! \u00a0Would Dave ever have realised this at retirement? Probably not and besides, it\u2019s too late.</p> <p>The trouble is most people never get to see this side of the story. Your superannuation statement never adds up all the compounded fees and commissions or tells you what these would have amounted to should they have remained invested in your fund.</p> <p>If they did it might go something like this:</p> <pre><code>Dear Mr Smith,\n\nCongratulations on working hard for 47 years. We are pleased to say that you have $1,362,212 in super for your retirement.\n\nHowever we regret to inform you that our fees, commissions and poor performance have resulted in a yearly 1.89% cost, \nwhich has deprived your fund of a total of $886,550 whilst you have faithfully been investing with us throughout your working life. \nWe hope you don\u2019t mind that this is almost 40% of your nest egg and trust that you won\u2019t miss it too much.\n\nThanks again for being such a great customer and so generously paying for my big beachside house.\n\nBest of luck in your old age\n\nYour Fund Manager\n\n\nP.S. We would have told you earlier about the effects of our fees but you never once contacted us to check, so naturally we thought you weren\u2019t really interested.\n\nP.P.S. And thanks so much for not asking our advisors for advice, which you have been paying for all this time. That\u2019s jolly nice of you not to bother us.\n</code></pre> <p>It does not have to be like this. The good news is most of you are free to switch to whatever fund you choose, and there are some standout low cost funds out there. With a hour or two\u2019s effort you could save yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars which could make all the difference to you and your family\u2019s retirement.</p> <p>Don\u2019t suffer like Dave and don\u2019t let them get away with it.

We often think of big changes like the  Agricultural Revolution as a massive  win for humans, but Harari flips that idea on its head. He suggests it might actually be \"history\u2019s biggest fraud\".  It's like we thought we were getting a great deal, but ended up with the short end of the stick.</p> <p>Think about it: our hunter-gatherer ancestors, they had a pretty good thing going on. They ate a diverse diet, didn't work all day, and moved around. Then we started farming, and suddenly we're stuck with wheat and cows, working way harder, and living in crowded spaces where diseases spread more easily. Yeah, the population went up, but were individuals actually happier? Nope. It\u2019s like, we got caught up in the idea of more food, but it actually meant less variety, harder work, and a tougher life for a lot of people.</p> <p>Now, that might sound pretty far removed from our lives today, but think about the modern \"luxury trap\" we're in. It's kind of the same thing, just with shiny gadgets and constant online shopping instead of crops and livestock. We're constantly told we need more stuff, that if we just get that new phone, the latest fashion item, or whatever, we\u2019ll be happier. But, just like with farming, all this extra stuff actually takes up our time and energy. We have to manage, clean, worry about all our possessions, and that takes time away from things that actually make us happy. It's all a bit ironic, isn't it? We work so hard to buy these things, but then they end up owning us in a way.</p> <p> </p> Commission earned on links <p>The links to Amazon.com on this page are referal links.

Thank you for your support!</p> <p>So, the parallel is this:</p> <ol> <li>Both the Agricultural Revolution and the luxury trap seem like steps forward, but they can make our lives more  complicated and less fulfilling.</li> <li>Both situations involve a kind of \"domestication\": we thought we were in charge of the crops, but they ended up  dictating our lives. Similarly, we think we control our possessions, but they often end up controlling our time and energy.</li> <li>We have these shared ideas, \"fictions\", like the idea that more is better, or the concept of money,  which drive both situations. Harari argues that the ability to believe in shared stories is what made us successful  as a species. But sometimes these stories can be misleading.</li> <li>We're not necessarily happier. Just like agriculture didn't bring about the paradise we thought it would,  the constant pursuit of material goods often leaves us feeling stressed and unfulfilled.</li> </ol> <p>Perhaps we should be a bit more critical about what we think of as progress.
