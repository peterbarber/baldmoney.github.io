## Why the Indexed Balanced Option?

### Lowest fees wins

Just because a fund manager charges more in fees does not ensure they provide better performance over the long term. 
In fact exactly the opposite has been shown to be the case after fees and costs are taken into account.

## Why choose an index fund over a managed fund?

### Managed Fund

A managed fund is managed by a human fund manager. That is, a person chooses which stocks should make up the fund 
and when to buy and sell these stocks. The fund manager charges a fees of usually between 0.5% and 2% of your total 
fund size.

### Index Fund

An index fund is managed automatically using an index rule and does not require a person to choose the stocks. 
For example the ASX 200 index is made up of the 200 biggest companies on the Australian stock exchange. 
As index fund simply tracks an index there is no fund manager to pay, so their fees are usually much lower than 
managed funds, typically around 0.1 to 0.5%. 

**Studies have shown that over 80% of fund managers fail to beat the equivalent index fund over the long term after 
deducting their fees. For this reason I think you will likely do better by simply following an index using an index 
tracking fund rather than a high fee charging managed fund.

## Small difference in fees, big difference in retirement
