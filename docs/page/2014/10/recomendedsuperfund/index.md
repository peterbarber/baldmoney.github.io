Why the Indexed Balanced Option?


**Firstly we have assumed that you are currently in the default ‘balanced’ option of your fund (80% of Australians are) and that you want to remain in the ‘balanced’ option.**

The Index Balanced choice from HostPlus has a typical balanced split of 75% growth and 25% defensive assets.

# Lowest fees wins

Just because a fund manager charges more in fees does not ensure they provide better performance over the long term. In fact exactly the opposite has been shown to be the case after fees and costs are taken into account.


As it’s name suggests the Indexed Balanced option is what’s known as an index tracking fund, why is this a good thing?

Why choose an index fund over a managed fund?


## Managed Fund

A managed fund is managed by a human fund manager. That is, a person chooses which stocks should make up the fund and when to buy and sell these stocks. The fund manager charges a fees of usually between 0.5% and 2% of your total fund size.

## Index Fund

An index fund is managed automatically using an index rule and does not require a person to choose the stocks. For example the ASX 200 index is made up of the 200 biggest companies on the Australian stock exchange. As index fund simply tracks an index there is no fund manager to pay, so their fees are usually much lower than managed funds, typically around 0.1 to 0.5%.

**Studies have shown that over 80% of fund managers fail to beat the equivalent index fund over the long term after deducting their fees. For this reason we think you will likely do better by simply following an index using an index tracking fund rather than a high fee charging managed fund.**
