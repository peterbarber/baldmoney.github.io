# Best NASDAQ 100 ETF (Australia, UK and US)

![](images/nasdaq100-2.png)

By 'best' I mean the lowest cost ETF that tracks the US NASDAQ 100 index.

## Why the NASDAQ 100?

Investing in the Nasdaq 100 can offer several potential benefits:

* **Exposure to Growth:** The Nasdaq 100 is heavily weighted towards technology and growth-oriented companies, which have historically shown strong long-term growth potential.
* **Diversification:** While concentrated in technology, the index still offers some diversification across various sectors within the technology space.
* **Ease of Investment:** Investors can gain exposure to the Nasdaq 100 through ETFs like the Invesco QQQ, making it relatively easy to invest in.
* **Potential for High Returns:** Historically, the Nasdaq 100 has outperformed broader market indices like the S&P 500 over the long term. Since 1985 the Nasdaq 100 has produced an annualized return of 14.06% (not including dividends).

**However, it's important to consider the risks:**

* **Volatility:** The Nasdaq 100 can be more volatile than broader market indices due to its concentration in high-growth sectors.
* **Concentration Risk:** The index is heavily influenced by a few large technology companies, which can increase risk if these companies underperform.
* **Economic Dependence:** The performance of the Nasdaq 100 is closely tied to the overall health of the technology sector and the global economy.
