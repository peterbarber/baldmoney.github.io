The winner is Wise which refreshingly does not have an exchange rate markup, unlike other providers where the 
exchange rate markup tends to be hidden away in their fee schedule. Instead, Wise is upfront about their fees, 
charging a transfer fee of 0.34% which is the lowest I could find.

!!! Info "Disclaimer - Referral link used"

    Full disclaimer, the link to Wise above is a [referral link](https://wise.com/campaign/universal-invite), 
    which means I get A$145 when 3 folks sign up and use the service. You also benefit by receiving a free transfer 
    up to A$1000 or a free card. I use this to pay back my time for researching the services available but it has 
    not influenced my recommendation of Wise as the most cost-effective international money transfer service, 
    I guess you'll just have to trust me.
