A friend asked me to look at [www.australianethical.com.au](http://www.australianethical.com.au) for your superannuation, I wasn’t very impressed. Maybe ethical for companies, but what about retirees?

1 – Fees are too high MySuper balanced option total fees are (1.134%). The lowest fees are Hostplus – indexed balanced option (0.03%) which works out at about $100,000 less in retirement for a 30 year old on $100,000 a year by age 67. (see moneysmart.gov.au calculator)

2 – Their 10 year performance of 3.7% is well below the average of 5.35% (superratings)

Is $100,000 worth it to outsource your ethics?
