title: "Financial advisors do not care about you"

You are the only person responsible for your financial future. If it all goes belly up YOU are to blame. Even if you have been given dodgy advice from a financial manager, itâ€™s upto you to do your homework and take responsibility for your investment choices. Do you know how much you are paying in fees?, Does your advisor get trailing commissions? Why have they recommended a certain product over another?

Advisors on commision actually have a conflict of interest, and it could be you that loses out. A alternative may be to see a centrelink financial advisor for free and unbiased advice or at least aan advisor who is paid a flat rate up front and does not accept commision.

Imagine the situation during the GFC where you have just lost 50% of your super annuation balance, the financial advisor just shrugs their shoulders and blames it on the market crash. How would you feel about your future now?
