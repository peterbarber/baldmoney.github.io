Just because something is expensive does not mean it is better. Cost is actually now part of the marketing of some products, for example Stella Artois does not hide this fact with the tag line ‘reassuringly expensive’ - think about:

1. Expensive wine - http://freakonomics.com/2010/12/16/freakonomics-radio-do-more-expensive-wines-taste-better/
2. A $1200 handbag from Burberry, does it last any longer than one from Aldi?
3. Private school fees
