I've been using Blinkist for a few months now and while the mobile had a few teething problems I'm pleased to say they now seem ot have been fixed with the latest release.

Blinkist summarises books into easy digestible 'Blinks' which can either be read or listnened to via the audio player built into the app. I've found it a great way to get the overall message of a book in about 10 minutes, rather than spending about 10 hours reading the full book.

All the titles are non fiction and there are plenty of blinks of well known finance books including:

- The Intelligent Investor
- Think and Grow Rich
- The Millionaire Next Door
