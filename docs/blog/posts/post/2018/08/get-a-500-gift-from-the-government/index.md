# How you ask?

From the superannuation co-contribution.

<!-- more -->

# How do I qualify?

1. Earn less than $49,488
2. Have 10% of your income from employment activities

# How does it work?

The government put in 50c for every $1 you contribute this financial year, up to this maximum of $500. So to get the maximum of $500 per year, you need to put in $1,000 per year as an after tax contribution.

You won’t often find a potential 50% guaranteed return.

Contact your superfund for details on how to make a contribution.
