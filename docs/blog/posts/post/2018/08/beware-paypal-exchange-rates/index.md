title: "Beware Paypal Exchange Rates"

It’s usually cheaper to use your credit card (especially if it’s the GE Money 28 Degrees card with 0% currency exchange fee) than to use the default exchange rate provided by Paypal which can be upto 4%

From Paypal's website

“PayPal’s exchange rate includes a processing fee above the base rate at which PayPal obtains foreign currency.”

So they add a cheeky margin to existing rates!

Instead opt to pay with your credit card (fees usually around 0-3%) for foreign currency transactions

Don’t get ripped off
